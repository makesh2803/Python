### ğŸ¤” Unpacking 
# coordinates = (1,2,3)
# x = coordinates[0]
# y = coordinates[1]
# z = coordinates[2]

### ğŸ¤” both programs, below and above, are correct, but below is shorter 
# coordinates = (1,2,3)
# x,y,z = coordinates
# print(x)

### ğŸ¤” we can do unpacking in lists as well
coordinates = [1,2,3]
x,y,z = coordinates
print(x)
